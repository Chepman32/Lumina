2. Implement export functionality
3. Add all free content (filters, stickers)
4. Basic IAP setup

### Long-term (1 Month)
1. Premium content creation
2. Polish animations and UX
3. Testing and optimization
4. App Store submission prep

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns
- **State Management**: Zustand with isolated stores
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Animation**: Reanimated 3 worklets for 60 FPS
- **Rendering**: Skia for custom graphics
- **Offline-First**: All content bundled, no network required

### Code Quality
- Strict TypeScript mode
- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable utilities
- Clean folder organization

### Performance
- Animated values run on UI thread
- Skia rendering optimized
- MMKV for ultra-fast storage
- Lazy loading planned
- Memory management planned

## 📝 Notes

- Using Reanimated 3.x (downgraded from 4.x due to worklets dependency)
- Expo packages included for image picker and media library
- New Architecture enabled for React Native
- Hermes engine enabled
- ccache available for faster rebuilds

## 🔧 Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
yarn ios

# Development
